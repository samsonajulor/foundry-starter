# NFT Marketplace Contract Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the planned functionality and flow of the NFT Marketplace contract. The contract aims to facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) in a secure and decentralized manner. This document explains the intended flow of the contract's functions in future tense.

## Contract Overview
- **Contract Name:** NFTMarketplace
- **Inheritance:** Inherits from ReentrancyGuard and Ownable contracts.

## Functions and Flow

### Constructor
- **Description:** The contract constructor will initialize the NFT Marketplace.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_nftContracts` (array of addresses): Addresses of accepted NFT contracts.
  - `_listingFee` (uint256): Listing fee required to create an order.
- **Flow:**
  - The constructor will initialize the contract with a list of accepted NFT contracts and set the listing fee.

### `setListingFee` Function
- **Description:** Allows the contract owner to set a new listing fee.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_newFee` (uint256): New listing fee.
- **Flow:**
  - The contract owner will be able to call this function to update the listing fee.

### `createOrder` Function
- **Description:** Sellers will use this function to create a new order for an NFT they own.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_tokenId` (uint256): The ID of the NFT to be sold.
  - `_price` (uint256): The price at which the NFT is listed.
  - `_deadline` (uint256): The deadline for the order.
  - `_signature` (bytes): Signature for verification.
- **Flow:**
  - The seller will send a transaction to create a new order with the specified NFT, price, deadline, and a signature.
  - The contract will check if the trade state is valid, if the NFT is not already listed, if the listing fee is paid, and if the deadline is in the future.
  - The contract will verify that the NFT contract is valid and approved to manage tokens.
  - If all conditions are met, the contract will create the order, increment the order counter, and emit an `OrderCreated` event.

### `confirmTrade` Function
- **Description:** Sellers or the contract itself can confirm the trade.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_orderId` (uint256): The ID of the order to confirm.
- **Flow:**
  - The seller or the contract will be able to call this function to confirm the trade.
  - The function will update the trade state to "Seller Confirmed" and emit a `TradeConfirmed` event.

### `executeOrder` Function
- **Description:** Buyers will execute the order to purchase the NFT.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_orderId` (uint256): The ID of the order to execute.
- **Flow:**
  - The buyer will send a transaction to execute the order by providing the order ID.
  - The contract will check if the order ID is valid.
  - If the trade state is "Seller Confirmed," the contract will verify the buyer's signature.
  - If the signature is valid, the contract will transfer the NFT to the buyer, the payment to the seller, and mark the order as inactive.

### `_validateSignature` Internal Function
- **Description:** Validates a signature against a given message hash.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `_signer` (address): The expected signer of the signature.
  - `hash` (bytes32): The message hash to verify.
  - `signature` (bytes): The signature to validate.
- **Flow:**
  - This internal function will be used to verify the validity of a signature.

## Events
The contract will emit several events to provide transparency and allow external systems to react to contract activities:
- `OrderCreated`: Triggered when a new order is successfully created.
- `OrderCancelled`: To be implemented if needed.
- `OrderExecuted`: Triggered when an order is successfully executed.
- `TradeConfirmed`: Triggered when a trade is confirmed.

## Conclusion
The NFT Marketplace contract, currently under development, will allow users to create orders for NFTs, confirm trades, and execute orders to transfer NFTs and payments. This PRD outlines the contract's planned functionality and the expected flow of its functions in future tense.
